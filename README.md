## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack & Project Structure

BitProwler is built with modern Apple technologies and follows a clean, MVVM-inspired architecture.

-   **UI**: SwiftUI
-   **Concurrency**: Swift Concurrency (`async`/`await`)
-   **Networking**: `URLSession`
-   **Data Persistence**: `UserDefaults` for settings, `KeychainAccess` for secure credentials.

The project structure is organized for clarity and scalability:
