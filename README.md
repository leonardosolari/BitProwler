## ✨ Features

BitProwler is packed with features to streamline your workflow.

#### Prowlarr Integration
- **Unified Search**: Seamlessly search across all your Prowlarr-configured indexers with a single query.
- **Advanced Sorting**: Sort search results by seeders, size, or publish date to find exactly what you need. Your choice is saved across app launches.
- **Smart Filtering**: Create and manage custom keyword filters to include or exclude results based on your criteria. Apply filters with AND/OR logic.
- **Search History**: Quickly access your recent searches.

#### qBittorrent Management
- **Live Torrent List**: View and monitor all your active torrents with real-time updates on progress, speed, and status. Sorting preferences are saved.
- **Comprehensive Actions**:
    - Pause, resume, and force start torrents.
    - Delete torrents (with or without downloaded data).
    - Move torrents to a new location on your server.
    - Recheck torrent integrity.
- **Add Torrents on the Go**: Add new torrents directly from the search view, or manually using a magnet link or a `.torrent` file.
- **Detailed View**: Tap a torrent to see detailed stats, or tap a search result for more information before downloading.
- **File Inspector**: View the individual files and their completion status within a torrent.
- **Path Management**: Remembers and suggests recent download paths for convenience.

#### General App Features
- **Modern UI**: A clean and responsive interface built entirely with SwiftUI.
- **Multi-Server Support**: Configure and switch between multiple Prowlarr and qBittorrent servers.
- **Secure**: Server credentials and API keys are stored securely in the device's Keychain.
- **Light & Dark Mode**: Fully supports system-wide appearance settings.
- **Full Italian Localization**: The app is fully translated and ready for more languages.

## 📋 Requirements
- **iOS 18.1** or later.
- **Xcode 16.1** or later to build.
- A self-hosted **Prowlarr** instance.
- A self-hosted **qBittorrent** instance with the WebUI enabled.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/BitProwler.git
    cd BitProwler
    ```
2.  **Open the project:**
    Open `BitProwler.xcodeproj` in Xcode. The project uses Swift Package Manager to handle dependencies, which will be resolved automatically.

3.  **Build and Run:**
    Select your device or a simulator and press `Cmd+R` to build and run the app.

### Configuration
The app is not functional until you configure your servers.
1.  Launch the app.
2.  Navigate to the **Settings** tab.
3.  Select **Prowlarr Servers** and add your server's URL and API key.
4.  Select **qBittorrent Servers** and add your server's URL, username, and password.
5.  Once added, make sure to select an active server for each service. The active server is indicated by a checkmark.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack & Project Structure

BitProwler is built with modern Apple technologies and follows a clean, MVVM-inspired architecture.

-   **UI**: SwiftUI
-   **Concurrency**: Swift Concurrency (`async`/`await`)
-   **Networking**: `URLSession` with a protocol-oriented service layer.
-   **Data Persistence**: `UserDefaults` for settings, `KeychainAccess` for secure credentials.
-   **Architecture**: The project uses a centralized `AppContainer` for Dependency Injection, ensuring a decoupled and testable codebase. Server management is handled elegantly via a `GenericServerManager` to reduce code duplication.

The project structure is organized for clarity and scalability:

```
